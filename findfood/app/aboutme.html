         This web site helps you locate food places in North America.
         The search can be done by entering type of food you want and the name of the area.
         The result is displayed in a table format, I have also put up a Map so that the user can
         see the exact location of the place. The markers also show some information regarding the
         place when clicked.

        You can also filter places based on distance and reviews.
        You can add places to your favourite's list. You can also write reviews on places.

        I have used yelp api and google maps api. The entire app is a single page application.
        So if you refresh you have to login again. I have used Angularjs, Nodejs, express and
        MongoDB.
